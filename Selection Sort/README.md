# ðŸ“Š Selection Sort (C Implementation)

This project demonstrates the **Selection Sort** algorithm implemented in the **C programming language** through a console-based application.

---

## What is Selection Sort?

**Selection Sort** is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm. It works by repeatedly selecting the minimum element from the unsorted portion and placing it at the beginning.

- Time Complexity: O(nÂ²)
- Space Complexity: O(1)
- Stable: Not stable by default

## Features

- User inputs array size and elements
- Array is sorted in ascending order using Selection Sort
- Sorted array is printed on the console

---

## Technologies Used

- Language: C
- Libraries: `stdio.h`

---

## How to Compile and Run

### Prerequisites

- A working C compiler (e.g., GCC, clang)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OsmanGundogdu/Selection-Sort.git
   cd Selection-Sort
