# Sorting and Median Finder (C Functions)

This is a **console-based application written in C** that allows the user to enter a list of numbers, sorts the array in ascending order, and then calculates the **median** value using modular functions.

---

## Features

- Sorts an array using simple sorting logic (e.g., bubble sort)
- Calculates the median of the array
- Uses modular functions for sorting and median calculation
- Repeats the process until the user quits

---

## Technologies Used

- C programming language
- Standard libraries: `stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`
